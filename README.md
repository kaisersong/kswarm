# KSwarm

> You have multiple AI agents — but coordinating them is harder than the work itself. KSwarm lets you define a goal, and it handles the rest: planning, dispatching, quality review, and delivery. Your agents become a team.

A multi-agent project coordination system built on [Intent Broker](https://github.com/nicepkg/intent-broker). Define a goal, KSwarm decomposes it into phased tasks, dispatches to the best available agents, reviews quality, and delivers results.

## How It Works

### Plan-Do Execution Model

KSwarm uses a structured **Plan-Do** model, not fire-and-forget task decomposition:

1. **PO generates a Plan** — Deep analysis, phased task breakdown, acceptance criteria per item
2. **Human approves** — Review the plan before execution starts
3. **Phase-aware dispatch** — Only the current phase's tasks are dispatched; next phase waits
4. **Runtime-safe execution** — dispatch routes through agent health, capability, and active-run leases
5. **File-based handoff** — large task context, requirements, evidence contracts, and artifact contracts are written to handoff files instead of oversized broker messages
6. **Quality review** — PO reads actual artifact content and evaluates against acceptance criteria
7. **Rework loop** — Failed reviews send tasks back with specific feedback
8. **Auto-synthesis** — When all phases complete, PO generates a final deliverable

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Hub is a pure state machine | No LLM calls in the hub — deterministic, testable, fast |
| PO Agent makes all decisions | Planning, dispatch strategy, quality gates — one accountable owner |
| Human gates at key moments | Approve plans, close projects — human stays in control |
| Phase-aware dispatch | Prevents premature parallel execution; respects dependency chains |
| Runtime health gates | Agents that are online but unable to execute are degraded, cooled down, and routed around |
| Deliverable contracts | Hard output requests such as PPTX are validated before PO review |
| Recoverable planning | Interrupted PO planning can be retried from the project detail page |
| Execution boundary | Xiaok Desktop seed agents must run in the full Desktop agent runtime; KSwarm does project management and never pretends to be an LLM worker |

## Features

### Core

- **Structured Planning** — PO analyzes goals, creates phased plans with rationale and acceptance criteria
- **Task State Machine** — `pending → dispatched → accepted → in_progress → submitted → done` with rework loop
- **Quality Review** — PO reads artifact content (not just filenames) and evaluates substance
- **Phase-aware Dispatch** — Only earliest incomplete phase dispatches; prevents premature parallel work
- **Capability-aware Routing** — Retries and dispatches route to healthy agents with matching task/output capability
- **Runtime Watchdogs** — Heartbeats, stdout/stderr telemetry, and stale-run detection prevent silent CLI hangs
- **Deliverable Contracts** — Explicit PPTX/HTML/Markdown tasks are validated before review
- **Plan Retry Recovery** — Projects interrupted during PO planning can be restarted safely
- **File Handoff Packages** — Task context is written to durable handoff packages so agents read large requirements and prior artifacts from files
- **Evidence Contracts** — Recent/monthly research tasks can require source evidence and current-date grounding before review passes
- **Formal Delivery Files** — Final delivery aliases use project/goal-based filenames instead of internal task IDs
- **Runtime Boundary Enforcement** — KSwarm maintenance workers can manage state, logs, and packaging, but user tasks are handed to real agents
- **Persistence** — Projects survive server restarts (debounced JSON state file)

### Web UI

- **Kanban Board** — 4-column board (Pending / In Progress / Submitted / Done)
- **Plan View** — Phase progress, acceptance criteria, review feedback per task
- **Real-time Updates** — WebSocket push for all state changes
- **Artifact Preview** — Inline markdown/HTML/JSON preview with download
- **Task Management** — Cancel tasks, add tasks mid-project, manual dispatch

### Agents

- **Multi-runtime Support** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, XiaoK, or any broker-compatible agent
- **Capability Matching** — Assign tasks based on agent skills
- **Health Monitor** — Detects stuck tasks (10min timeout), reassigns or PO takes over
- **Concurrent Execution** — Multiple agents work in parallel within a phase

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: intent-broker running on localhost:4318
# cd ~/intent-broker && npm start

cd kswarm
npm install

# Start the API server (port 4400)
node src/server/index.js

# Start the web UI (port 5173)
cd web && npx vite --port 5173

# Start PO agent (will handle planning + dispatch + review)
node scripts/auto-worker.js cli-claude Claude

# (Optional) Start additional worker agents
node scripts/auto-worker.js cli-codex Codex
node scripts/auto-worker.js 79aac2f5-ace AQ
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — create a project, set a goal, and watch agents collaborate.

## Usage

### Create a Project

Via Web UI or API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4400/projects \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Product Strategy",
    "goal": "Create a 6-month product strategy with competitive analysis",
    "requirements": "At least 3 rounds of adversarial review",
    "poAgent": "cli-claude",
    "members": ["cli-codex", "79aac2f5-ace"]
  }'
```

### Project Lifecycle

```
Created → [Human Approves] → Active → [Tasks Execute] → Delivered → [Human Closes] → Closed
```

## Version History

**v0.8.0** — Swarm execution boundary and evidence release: Xiaok Desktop seed agents are routed to the full Desktop agent runtime instead of local auto-worker execution; task handoff packages move large context and artifact contracts into files; source/evidence contracts calibrate recent and monthly research review; artifact-first completion prevents empty summary-only results; final deliverables use formal filenames and delivery aliases; failed/blocked historical retry children no longer hold project delivery hostage.

**v0.7.0** — Reliable execution hardening: runtime probes and health cooldowns, capability-aware dispatch/retry routing, stalled-run watchdogs with heartbeat/stdout/stderr telemetry, strict deliverable contracts for PPTX/HTML/Markdown tasks, deterministic local executor fallback for explicit PPTX presentation tasks, restart recovery for active runs, and retryable planning when the PO planning phase is interrupted.

**v0.6.0** — Plan-Do execution model: structured planning with phases, quality review with artifact content reading, phase-aware dispatch, offline worker fallback (PO auto-takes-over), rework loop, persistence across restarts.

**v0.5.0** — Web UI: kanban board, plan view, real-time WebSocket updates, artifact preview, task cancel.

**v0.4.0** — Quality review system: PO reads artifacts and evaluates against acceptance criteria; pass/fail with feedback; rework loop.

**v0.3.0** — Persistence: projects survive server restarts; debounced JSON state file.

**v0.2.0** — Connected to real intent-broker; multi-agent dispatch; auto-worker runtime.

**v0.1.0** — Initial prototype: template planner, mock dispatch, demo.
